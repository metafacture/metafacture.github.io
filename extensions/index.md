# Extensions

## Overview
Here you will find different extensions and plugins related to the [Metafacture project](https://metafacture.org) in order to support working with the framework Metafacture. At the current state there are provided VS Code / Codium Extensions for Fix language and Flux language. Both extensions are aiming to support working with Fix and Flux by syntax highlighting, simple auto completion and validation of the Flux/Fix language.
In the future there could be extensions and plugins for other IDEs than VS Code / Codium.

## Setup an extension
There are different ways to install extensions for VS Code / Codium.

1. The first one is to install from a marketplace. If you use VS Code, the default marketplace is [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode), for VS Codium it's [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/). All extensions which are presented here are published to both marketplaces.

2. The second way to install is to download a VSIX file and install from it. You can download the latest version of the VSIX files for [Fix](https://wwww.metafacture.org/extensions/fix-0.0.1.vsix) and [Flux](https://wwww.metafacture.org/extensions/flux-0.0.1.vsix). Use the **Install from VSIX** command in the Extensions view drop-down menu and point to the downloaded VSIX.
