## Overview


## Setup an extension
There are different ways to install extensions for VS Code / Codium.
1. The first one is to install from a marketplace. If you use VS Code, the default marketplace is [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode), for VS Codium it's [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/). All extensions which are presented here are published to both marketplaces.
2. The second way to install is to download a VSIX file and install from it. You can download the latest version of the VSIX files for [Fix](https://wwww.metafacture.org/extensions/fix-0.0.1.vsix) and [Flux](https://wwww.metafacture.org/extensions/flux-0.0.1.vsix). Use the **Install from VSIX** command in the Extensions view drop-down menu and point to the downloaded VSIX.
