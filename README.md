Under /extensions are provided the newest versions of the VS Code / Codium extensions of Flux and Fix. There is an index.md file which is converted via GitHub Actions on every push to an index.html which contains further information about installation and content of the extensions.
The source of the extensions can be found under https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-flux and https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-fix. In these repositories you can find instructions to start the extensions in developer mode.
